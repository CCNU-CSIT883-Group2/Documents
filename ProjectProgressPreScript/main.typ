= Intruduction

Good morning/afternoon everyone. We are pleased to present our project, ChatCNU, and share the progress we've made in developing this innovative educational tool.

== Inspiration

In recent years, the rapid advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technology have demonstrated significant potential in education and learning. Recognizing this potential, we set out to harness GAI's strengths to create a tool that simplifies and enhances the educational process. Our goal is to make AI resources more accessible and effective for both students and educators.

== Objective

Our project aims to develop a web-based Q&A application that leverages the powerful text-generation capabilities of GAI. This application will enable personalized study for students by generating questions in specific subjects. It will also provide tools for users to easily create and manage quizzes, thereby enhancing the learning experience for university students and educators alike.

== Innovation

While many existing tools guide users on how to write effective prompts for learning through AI, they often fall short in managing the generated content. The content produced by GAI can be disorganized and difficult to navigate. Our platform addresses this issue by not only generating answers but also organizing, storing, and visualizing the results in an intuitive and user-friendly way. This ensures that the content is easily accessible and manageable for users.

== Job Distribution

This is our job distribution.

Our application is built upon four key components: the frontend, the backend, the database, and a program library that interacts with various GAI tools. These components are seamlessly integrated to form three subsystems:

	1.	Question Management System: Allows for the creation, organization, and retrieval of questions and answers.
	2.	Account System: Manages user accounts, permissions, and profiles for both students and teachers.
	3.	Evaluation System: Provides tools for assessing student performance and offering feedback.

By integrating these subsystems, we aim to provide a comprehensive platform that enhances the educational experience.

== Resources

We have utilized several resources to reach our current stage:

- Documentation for Vue and its ecosystem has been instrumental for our frontend development.
- Django documentation has guided our backend development efforts.
- GAI tools like ChatGPT, Marscode, and Kimi that can generate text-based questions.
- Our PCs have been essential tools throughout the development process.

In the future, we plan to utilize:

- A dedicated database server to handle increased data loads.

- A backend server for deployment and comprehensive testing.

- More GAI Tools' API
