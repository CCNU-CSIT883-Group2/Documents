= Introduction

Our team is developing an intelligent question-and-answer software aimed at enhancing the learning experience for university students and instructors. This platform will enable personalized study for students and provide tools for teachers to easily create and manage quizzes. The software will leverage the powerful text-generation capabilities of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) to support this functionality. Additionally, our application is web-based, allowing users to access our service anytime, anywhere.

== Inspiration

The rapid advancements in Generative AI technology have demonstrated its potential in the fields of education and learning. We believe we can harness its strengths to create a tool that simplifies and enhances the educational process, making AI resources more accessible and effective for both students and educators.

== Innovation

Our initial research suggests that there are currently few, if any, applications that offer the kind of functionality we propose. 
While many tools guide users on how to write effective prompts for learning through AI, the content generated by GAI is often poorly managed. 
Students and teachers must organize and handle this content manually, which is both inefficient and time-consuming. 
Our software aims to solve this problem by offering a solution that not only generates answers but also organizes, stores, and visualizes the results in an intuitive and user-friendly way. In doing so, it also supports personalized learning for students and simplifies quiz creation and management for teachers.

= Functions

Our application is designed with two primary user groups in mindâ€”students and teachers. Both will have access to shared functions that enhance their learning and teaching experience, while each group will also enjoy features tailored to their specific needs.

== Shared

=== Personalized Questions Creation

Both students and teachers can create personalized questions based on course material. Students can tailor questions to their study needs, while teachers can generate custom quizzes, ensuring a more targeted and effective learning experience.

=== Questions Management

The software will offer centralized management of all questions. Users can categorize, store, and retrieve questions efficiently. This feature helps both students and teachers organize their study or teaching materials, reducing the manual effort required to manage generated content.

== Student Side

=== Answers and Analysis

Students can answer the questions generated by GAI and receive AI-generated answers based on course material and keywords. The platform will also provide analysis of the answers, offering additional explanations or highlighting key concepts to enhance understanding.

=== Results Visualization

Students will be able to visualize their performance through intuitive charts and graphs, showing progress over time. This feature helps students track their strengths and weaknesses, making it easier to focus on areas that need improvement.

=== Mistake Bank

The software will automatically store incorrect answers in a personalized "Mistake Bank". This allows students to revisit their mistakes, review correct solutions, and reinforce learning by focusing on areas where they have struggled.

== Teacher Side

=== Questions Import and Export

Teachers can easily import and export questions in various formats. This function allows educators to streamline quiz creation by uploading existing questions or exporting quiz data for external use or archiving.

= Job Distribution

Our application is built on modern web technologies and is divided into four key subsystems: Frontend, Backend, Database, and a General Library to interact with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI). Each subsystem will have its dedicated responsibilities to ensure smooth development and seamless integration.

== Frontend

The frontend subsystem will focus on building an intuitive and responsive user interface for both students and teachers. 

*Members:*

- abc

== Backend

The backend subsystem will be responsible for interacting with frontend and database, and leverage the GAI Library to fullfil the functionality of the application. 

*Members:*

- abc

== Database

The database subsystem will handle the data architecture and management.

*Members:*

- abc

== General Library to Interact with GAI

This subsystem will be in charge of developing the general module that interacts with Generative AI, but this library will only serve for our specific function.
