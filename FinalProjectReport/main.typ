=== Non-functional Requirements

==== Usability Requirements

The "Intelligent Q&A platform" project adopts a fully decoupled architecture, with the frontend using the Vue framework and the backend using the Django framework. This architecture provides great flexibility and scalability. The separation between the frontend and backend makes the development, testing, and deployment of each module independent and efficient, reducing the maintenance challenges caused by interdependencies. Meanwhile, the responsive design of the Vue framework enhances the user experience, with the frontend pages being simple yet sophisticated. The exquisite design and meticulous interaction optimizations allow users to interact with the application easily and efficiently.

On the backend, Django provides powerful functionality and scalability, efficiently handling business logic and data interactions. Its built-in middleware mechanism allows developers to easily extend and configure the system, ensuring high availability. Additionally, Django's ORM simplifies database operations, reduces the likelihood of developer errors, and minimizes system failures. This greatly lowers the error rate during program execution and enhances the robustness and responsiveness of the user interface.

==== Reliability Requirements

Reliability refers to the ability of a system to continuously and stably provide the expected functionality over an extended period, primarily influenced by factors such as system architecture, fault handling, and data consistency.

The reliability of the "Intelligent Q&A platform" project is reflected in multiple aspects. First, the backend of the system is highly robust. Through reasonable error handling mechanisms, transaction management, and rollback strategies, it can effectively process and recover from various unexpected errors, preventing system crashes or data inconsistencies. For database operations, the system has designed appropriate table structures, indexes, and constraints to ensure data consistency and integrity, allowing it to remain reliably operational even under high concurrency or heavy load.

Secondly, the system's containerized deployment (via Docker) provides an independent and isolated runtime environment for both the database and backend services, reducing interference between different modules. This isolation allows the system to recover more reliably when faced with sudden failures.

Finally, with a comprehensive monitoring and logging system in place, the system can detect issues promptly and use automated methods for fault diagnosis and resolution, thereby enhancing the overall reliability of the system.

==== Performance Requirements

Program response time is one of the key indicators of user experience, especially in high-concurrency scenarios, where the system's ability to maintain fast responses directly impacts user satisfaction. The "Intelligent Q&A platform" project minimizes the latency between frontend rendering and backend data requests through a carefully designed frontend-backend separation architecture.

The frontend uses the Vue framework, which leverages virtual DOM technology to effectively enhance page rendering speed. For data that needs to be frequently updated, Vue employs an efficient data binding and component update mechanism, updating only the necessary parts when data changes, avoiding unnecessary re-renders and improving response speed.

The backend uses the Django framework, with performance optimizations that include data caching, database index optimization, and query optimization. The project uses MySQL for the database, and through the rational design of indexes and query logic, it improves query efficiency and reduces database response time. In the case of high-concurrency requests, the backend can also extend the caching layer (such as Redis) to enhance data query speed, further reducing response delays and improving program access time.

==== Security Requirements

Security refers to the system's ability to prevent various types of attacks and ensure that data is not leaked, tampered with, or lost. A highly secure system needs to consider multiple aspects, including data protection, identity authentication, and access control.

The security of the "Intelligent Q&A platform" project is reflected in its multi-layered security strategy. First, the backend leverages the security mechanisms built into the Django framework, such as protections against SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which effectively prevent common web attacks. Additionally, communication between the frontend and backend uses the HTTPS protocol, ensuring that data is not intercepted or tampered with during transmission.

Furthermore, the project implements strict user access control mechanisms, ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive data within the system. Through fine-grained permission management, the system ensures that users with different roles can only access information they are authorized to view, effectively preventing data leaks and unauthorized access.

The containerized deployment of the database and the security settings of the cloud server further enhance the overall security of the system. Containerization provides isolation, reducing potential security risks, while the security configurations and regular updates of the cloud server ensure that the system can withstand external attacks.

=== Product Characteristics

This project is a web-based intelligent question generation platform that meets users' needs for custom question creation. It can continuously track users' activity details, including question practice details, accuracy tracking, and statistics such as the proportion of completed questions. Compared to other AI platforms, this project focuses more on user experience and customization needs. Not only does it feature a user-friendly interface, but the entire page design is exceptionally simple, with all elements following human intuition for a quick learning curve. In terms of question generation, it can fully automate the organization and recording of user-generated questions, offering intelligent processing that saves time and improves learning efficiency. The project is primarily composed of three subsystems: the user management system, the question management system, and the statistics system.

The user management system allows users to register, log in, and log out, while also providing personalized modification features. Users can change their username, password, email address, and other personal information.

The question management system is a large and comprehensive subsystem. It allows users to customize the questions they wish to generate by providing various details such as the subject, topic, difficulty, type, and quantity of the questions. This enables users to accurately generate questions according to their specific needs. In addition to these features, the system also provides a history tracking function. All questions generated by users are automatically saved into a history record set, which details the time of generation, question difficulty, number of questions, as well as the user's own time spent on the questions and their completion progress. Users can also search through the history record set based on criteria such as subject and topic. In addition to these technical features, the user interface (UI) of this part is also designed with various details in mind. The clean and tidy UI allows users to efficiently use all the functions of the question management system based on their intuition. The system also enables users to customize the color scheme of the UI, catering to their long-term usage needs and providing a more personalized and comfortable experience.

The statistics system records all user activity details within the platform. From the moment a user logs into the platform and starts generating questions, the system begins tracking their actions. It continuously monitors the changes in every history record set created by the user, updating in real-time with each new action, such as question generation, submission, and redoing. The system automatically categorizes and organizes the data based on the subject and topic of the questions. Finally, all the computed data is displayed in graphical format on the data statistics page, making it easy for users to view and analyze their progress and performance.

== Project Closing and Lessons-learnt

=== Overview

The Intelligent Q&A platform System project aimed to develop an AI-powered platform that enables users to generate personalized and precise question banks, along with intelligent data analysis functionalities to improve learning efficiency. The project spanned three months, encompassing phases of requirement analysis, system design, development, testing, and final deployment.

=== Closing Summary

The System has been successfully completed and deployed, with core functionalities operational, including intelligent question bank generation, customizable settings, and data analysis. User testing indicated that the system significantly improved learning efficiency and personalized learning experiences. However, compared to the initial goals, there are some shortcomings:

- Incomplete Achievement of Planned Features: Advanced features like enhanced model selection and support for complex question types were not fully realized.
- Time Management Issues: The project timeline was overly compressed, leading to delays or compromises in some functionalities.
- Technical Complexity: Integration and optimization of large model APIs consumed more time and resources than anticipated.

Overall, user feedback was positive, highlighting the system's efficiency and data analysis capabilities. However, some users suggested further improvements in interface design and performance optimization.

=== Lessons Learned

==== Effective Utilization of Management Tools

While the project team employed basic task management tools (e.g., task breakdown and progress tracking), more advanced project management tools were not adequately utilized to address communication and collaboration challenges within the team. For future projects, more refined tools (e.g., Gantt charts, sprint planning) should be adopted to enhance efficiency.

==== Realistic Goal Setting

The project initially set ambitious goals (e.g., covering all major question types and supporting multiple languages) without fully considering team size and resource constraints. This resulted in unachievable targets that affected team morale. Future projects should focus on realistic, achievable goals and implement them incrementally.
